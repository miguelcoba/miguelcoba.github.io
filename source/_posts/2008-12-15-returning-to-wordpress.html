After giving MovableType a very long try, we finally decided to switch back to WordPress. We found some things we didn't like:
<ul>
	<li>Not easy way to add a blogroll (it is just a link, man!)</li>
	<li>Slow workflow from login to publish post</li>
	<li>Few choices for themes</li>
	<li>Problems with the non-commercial/commercial/enterprise scheme of licensing</li>
	<li>Good plugins costs $$$</li>
</ul>
After using both, we think that, although MT is now an open source project, it needs more time to reach the usability and feature level of WP.
