It appears that the problem affects all the systems that are related to Debian.

From Erich Schubert's <a href="http://blog.drinsama.de/erich/en/linux/2008051401-consequences-of-sslssh-weakness.html" title="Erich Schubert">blog</a>:

"<strong>Any Linux/Unix/*BSD system is vulnerable that <em>grants access</em> to a key that was generated on an affected Debian or Ubuntu system"</strong>

Well, sysadmins, time to work! :)
