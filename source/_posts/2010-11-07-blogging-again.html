A lot of time since the last post.

Well, I was very busy. A lot of work, a lot of projects. A lot of new things to learn. Sometimes I felt like my head was going to explode. A bit overloaded like Neo's Kung-Fu imprinting. But in a non sci-fi way, that is, reading a lot, experiementing a lot, trying not to fall asleep at nights, trying not to fall asleep in work. This week I will be releasing other project to production and after a couple o weeks I will be very busy processing all the information collected by it. And in december I will start one another new project. So, a lot of work, but I am happy, because the first half of the year was a hard one for us. Now the things are a little better.

Between the things I learned/used this year are:
<ul>
	<li><a title="Groovy Language" href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/" target="_blank">Groovy</a></li>
	<li><a title="Grails framework" href="http://grails.org/" target="_blank">Grails</a></li>
	<li>Ruby's <a title="ShowOff web presentation software" href="https://github.com/schacon/showoff" target="_blank">ShowOff</a></li>
	<li><a title="Git SCM" href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a></li>
	<li><a title="Redmine project management web application" href="http://www.redmine.org/" target="_blank">Redmine</a></li>
	<li><a title="Hudson  Extensible continuous integration server " href="http://hudson-ci.org/" target="_blank">Hudson</a></li>
	<li><a title="The pomodoro technique" href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">The Pomodoro Technique</a></li>
	<li><a title="Phusion Passenger" href="http://www.modrails.com/">Phusion Passenger</a></li>
</ul>
In subsequent posts I will write about the issues I had installing and using each of those technologies.

I'm back and have a lot to share.
