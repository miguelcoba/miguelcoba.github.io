I have a new personal project.

To read and comprehend fully the SICP book (<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/</a>).

I found this book several years ago and I bookmarked it but never really went into it. The last time I tried, I started the first chapter and made some exercices before jumping to something  else.

This time is different. I have been reading and doing exercises constantly for the last 3 weeks. Man this book is hard but at the same time very rewarding. I must say that I am hooked and each day, after work and until late night, I find myself working on exercises. Obviously, next day is hard to wake up but I am happy because since long I haven't felt this way about learning something new.

Learning from this book is like being in college again. I feel great because I'm learning from really bright minds.

Anyway, I have the goal to finish the book and do all the exercises. To keep track of this I have created a project on github where I will publish the progress made. The project, if you're interested is <a title="SICP github project" href="https://github.com/miguelcoba/SICP" target="_self">here</a>. I have finished the first chapter (46 exercises) and I am currently doing the second chapter exercises. Even with only having read the first chapter, I must say, that this book is in its own league and I wish I had started this task before!
