Although I was using Debian Lenny for several months now, without a single problem I must say, it is always good to see an official release of <a title="Debian" href="www.debian.org">Debian</a>.

Today Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 Lenny was <a title="Debian 5.0 released" href="http://www.debian.org/News/2009/20090214">released</a>.

Now, to upgrade my clients' servers, as for mines are already on Lenny.
