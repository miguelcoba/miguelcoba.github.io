After reading my first post written in English, my wife told me: "you are a show off, are you going to write all your posts in English now?" Je, nop, I said, just the computer related ones. The rest are going to be in Spanish just like now. Why? Well, although my mother tongue is Spanish and I feel really proud of it, in the Internet to convey your ideas about computers, computer languages and programming techniques you should use English in order to reach the highest audience.

For example, when I was searching documentation and tutorials about <a href="http://seaside.st" title="Seaside">Seaside,</a> the most complex example application I could find was a tutorial in <a href="http://www.root.cz/clanky/seaside-1/" title="Seaside tutorial in Czech">Czech.</a> It was a shock. That was the most feature complete application I have ever (even today) found in the internet but, because the language barrier, it was almost as reading Chinese. I have nothing against Czech or Chinese and to make it clear, I am not pro-English neither, but the reality is, in IT, the English language is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca" title="Lingua franca">lingua franca</a>.

So, from now on, I will write in English all my technical related posts.

Hopefully, my wife will understand :D
