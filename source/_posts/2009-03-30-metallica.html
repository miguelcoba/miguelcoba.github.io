Finally, after 10 years waiting for this to happen, I have my tickets for Metallica.

The last time they came to Mexico I was in my first year of university and totally broke because I didn't worked yet and I depended financially from my mother. So I couldn't go.

Now the things are different and I can, fortunatelly, pay for this sort of things. Aline and I have assisted to a <a title="Concerts" href="http://miguel.leugim.com.mx/index.php/2008/01/29/conciertos/">lot of concerts</a> and some of them were really memorable. For her, <a title="Radiohead concert" href="http://aline.leugim.com.mx/index.php/2009/03/18/radiohead/">Radiohead</a> was the <em>Ã¼berkonzert</em>, not only for the music and the group themselves, that were really good, but also for the time waiting for the artist to return. Besides, not knowing if they will return added a lot of more anxiety to the waiting.

Now it is my turn to enjoy this concert. June, 6th is the date.

I'm really happy now :)
