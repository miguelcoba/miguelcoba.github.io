I am very tired.

Two long months trying to push my project out of the door.

I never thought that it would be so hard. Indeed it is very hard. You have to have your nose into everything. It is not just the application, that per se is already a very demanding mental and physical activity, but also the paperwork to start a business, the paperwork, the money, fees, taxes, lawyers, the banks, etc. And don't forget the operational ones: the domain, the SSL certificate, the merchant account, the gateway for the credit card transactions, the look &amp; feel of the app, the database, the unit testing, the functional testing, the load testing. And all of this in your free time, after day work, in the night, sometimes until dawn. Sleeping bad, sleeping with the eyes open in the day. Trying to get more hours of a single day.

Don't forget the beta testers. I don't have anything against them, in fact they are the most valuable source of feedback for the app. Without them I would be building beautiful and almost-useless feature-loaded apps that in my fantasy world would met the user needs. They prevent the application to grow into a mess. This alone deserves my most grateful respect for them. But they also give you ideas of new features that, they say, it would be absolutely nice to have in version 1.0. It is easy to consent and add the features to the app. But if you do this, it will never be a version 1.0. So one of the most dificult things in this long way to 1.0 it is to politely say: thank you very much but not in this version. The good thing is, they know that you are hearing them.

Finally, the fear.

This is the most dificult one. Every three or four minutes you think, this is not going to work. This will have no value for anybody. This will be a big failure. Well, it may be. Nothing is for sure. But I try to overcome the fear and to imagine that everything it will be alright. Look, the worst thing that can happen it is that nobody like it. Well, nobody has died of depression (I hope).

The fear is a very powerful enemy. You can't see it, you can't forget it. You can't buy something that makes it disappear. The only thing you can do is confront it. If, at the end, everything goes wrong, you can say that you tried hard.

I'm trying hard. I have fear but I'm trying.

Hopefully, this period will pass soon and I could see if it was worth the effort. Besides, no matter the outcome, I'm learning a lot in the process.

So here I'm, trying to reach 1.0. I can see the finish line already. A little more. Another push.
