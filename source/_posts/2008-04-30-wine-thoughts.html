In this moment I am drunk.

And happy. A lot. The spiritual drinks (wine this day) are very strange. Some would say they are magical. Others that they are a drug. I'll say that they are part of the humanity. When we are happy, when we are sad. In the success and in the tragedy. Alcohol has been always part of our lives. Wine, beer, fruit derivatives. A lot of options, a lot of flavors, a lot of circumstances. The fact is, they change (for a couple hours) our perception of life. My wife considers the wine the most mystical beverage (influenced a lot by her love for the ancient Greek's culture and philosophie). I tend to agree with her. I agree with her fully in days like this. The Wine has a very tasteful flavor. And the sensation of being drunk with wine it is very different as being drunk with tequila, for example. It is soft. It is happy. In fact, I don't think that someone sad could wish to be drunk with wine. The wine is for special moments. For happy ones. For memorable things. Or just for communion with the life. In this moment I don't care for anything except this peaceful, grateful and happiness moment.

My wife, the love of my life, is reading her book.

I feel the taste of the remains of the wine in my tongue. Delicious.

My son is in the room besides ours. Every now and then we hear his breath.

Today I played with him. It is growing very fast.

My son, Aline, the wine, the peaceful state of mind.

A very good moment.
