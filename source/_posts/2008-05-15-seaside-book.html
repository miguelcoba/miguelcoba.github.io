Last weekend I installed LaTeX and began to write my first book.

It is a book about <a href="http://seaside.st" title="Seaside">Seaside</a>.

I want to include, at least, the following topics:
<ul>
<li>Seaside basics</li>
<li>Advanced Seaside</li>
<li>Ajax</li>
<li>Announcements</li>
<li>Persistance (GLORP,  Magma,  GemStone/S)</li>
<li>Scalability (load balancing, static content caching)</li>
<li>Deployment (big iron, VPS, Amazon EC2)</li>
<li>Unit Testing</li>
<li>Maintenance (monitoring, updating)</li>
<li>Magritte (just a little)</li>
<li>Data export (JSON/REXX)</li>
</ul>
I am thinking of creating a full application, from design to deployment, following an agile process (write a test, write the code, you know). Of course it will be hard as I'm by no means an expert, but in writing the book I will learn a lot more about Seaside, and at the same time this knowledge will be preserved in print.

I have read <em>An introduction to Seaside by Michael Perscheid et al</em> and I know about the book that St√©phane Ducasse and others are writing. Also I have read all I could from Ramon Leon's blog, Lukas Renggli's blog and the mailing lists. In spite of that I think that something else is necessary. This is my little contribution to the Seaside documentation.

I don't have idea how long this will take as I have never written a book (except my thesis). I have just finished the first chapter, but I hope that as the time pass I will write faster.

Wish me luck!
