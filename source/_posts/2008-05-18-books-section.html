I have created a books section in my website. You can find it here:

<a href="http://leugim.com.mx/books" title="Books">http://leugim.com.mx/books</a>

Right now you can only find the first chapter of <em>Historias de Tristania</em>, but soon I will publish the first chapter of <em>Web Development With Seaside.</em>

Enjoy.
