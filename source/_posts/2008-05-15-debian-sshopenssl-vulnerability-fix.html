Today I updated the Debian GNU/Linux machines under my control in order to apply the fixes for <a href="http://www.debian.org/security/2008/dsa-1571" title="DSA-1571">DSA-1571</a> and <a href="http://www.debian.org/security/2008/dsa-1576" title="DSA-1576">DSA-1576</a>.

I had to regenerate several keys in the servers but now it appears to be all safe again.

That was an error from a Debian package mantainer but, in spite of that, Debian remains my GNU/Linux distribution of choice.
