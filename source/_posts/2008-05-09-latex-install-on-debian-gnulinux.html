Today I began to use LaTeX to write technical documents.

I learned that teTeX, the original default TeX distribution (LaTeX need TeX to work) on Debian is no longer maintained. The current default is TeXLive. So I installed it with:

# aptitude install texlive

This downloaded 338 MB of packages (when I tried to install texlive-full it offered to download 582MB, no thanks) .

I found <a href="http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf" title="LaTeX guide">this</a> very helpful guide to LaTeX from Tobias Oetiker et al.

Now to write LaTeX documents.
