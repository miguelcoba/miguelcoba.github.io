Yes, it is official.

We are going to have another baby.

The last weekend we went to the doctor and we saw the baby for the first time. He/she is 3 cm long and we heard also the sound of the heart. According to the doctor words everything is ok and we are very happy.

Aline is very tired all days and Trist√°n has more energy than ever but the happiness is bigger.

And we have the first pictures of the baby too :)
