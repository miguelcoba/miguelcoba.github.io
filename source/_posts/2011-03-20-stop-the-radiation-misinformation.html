I'm really tired of hearing people saying that the wolrd is comming to an end because of the Japanese leakage of radiation after the explotions in the nuclear plant of Fukushima, Japon. So I get this on the twitter stream and I republish it here also.

Read and analyse.

Is an issue, but not a world catastrophe!
